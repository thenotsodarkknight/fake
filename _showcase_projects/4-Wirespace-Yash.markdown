Wirespace was developed collectively by [Kumar Saurav](https://github.com/krsrv), [Kumar Saunack](https://github.com/saunack) and [Yash Shah](https://github.com/ys1998), for simplifying file sharing amongst people in the same network.

It is a decentralized file server application which, if permitted, allows clients to directly access file storage on the server side. To put it simply, the software creates a local file server which clients can connect to and read/write directly. The project runs on the browser, so only the server needs to have a copy of the software - the only exception being when the client wants to use the in-place editor.

The repository resides [here]({{ page.repo }}).
