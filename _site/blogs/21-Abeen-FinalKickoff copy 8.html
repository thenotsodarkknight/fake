    <meta name="description" content="Web and Coding Club is one of the biggest clubs of IIT Bombay. As a part of the Students' Technical Activities Body, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. Our aim is to propagate the enthusiasm for coding in the institute and especially amongst freshmen. We believe that every student here at IITB should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start." />

                        <hr />

<p>Since the last few days, it has been raining cats and dogs here in Mumbai; potholes have reappeared, trains have been cancelled, schools have been closed and from the watchman of my building to the professors at the college to the autowallahs, everyone is equally concerned about the fact - that how is Messi underperforming in this World Cup? He even missed a Penalty! Aisa kaise chalega?”. That is exactly how unifying football and World Cups are in this diverse nation of ours.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Have you ever noticed that there are three kinds of people? One, who watch football games every week in every year of their lives. These people are often branded as ‘jobless’. These are those people who flood your social media with unnecessary information about their favourite clubs and how their favourite player is the best player, which you graciously ignore. They follow football more than how an amorous stalker follows his (or her) predators, keeping a note of every player’s move. Then comes those people who know about football, but just watch the World Cups. They like football but just as a friend. These people fall under the ‘pretentious’ class. Their football stats get updated every four years, and yet in every World Cup you see them suddenly feigning their love for football under ‘peer pressure’. Then comes the third kind - those who never watch football and called ‘crazy’. Sorry, we aren’t allowed to talk about them</p>

<p>This year’s World Cup began with two favourites suffering from premature elimination - that’s right! Italy and the Netherlands. It was over for them even before it actually started. With these two countries unable to qualify for the World Cup, football fans sought refuge under other favourites, namely, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, and Germany. The braver souls went for France, Belgium and England. But little did anyone know that this World Cup had a bit of an ironical Midas’ Touch attached to it. With every team you ‘touched’, instead of ‘turning into gold’, they got eliminated. People changed their favourite teams in a week more than they changed underwears.</p>

<p>With France, Belgium, England and Croatia going through to the semi-finals, England Fans back home had already assumed that they were winning the World Cup. There were parades of “It’s coming home”, everywhere in England! There was a probably even a guy outside the Heathrow Airport standing with the placard, “Mere Karan, Arjun aur World Cup Aayenge”. It was probably this over-confidence that led to their unanticipated defeat against Croatia. The last time England was in the Semi-finals, Croatia wasn’t even a country.</p>

<p>This World Cup has been full of drama. From Ronaldo’s free kick screamer to Neymar’s diving and rolling to an Indian Messi fan commiting suicide because of his performance, it has been a rollercoaster ride on and off screen. This was a World Cup of Firsts, the First World Cup with VAR (Video Assistant Referees) being used; the First World Cup for Iceland and Panama; the first time an Asian side (Japan) defeated a South American nation (Columbia) at the FIFA World Cup; the first time, ‘Fair Play’ was used as a parameter to differentiate between teams for qualification (Japan was qualified for the knockout stages because of lesser yellow cards); the first Penalty Shootout Win for England and the first World Cup Final for Croatia.</p>

<p>As I write this article, France is yet to face Croatia for the finals. So I close my laptop, put on my France jersey, finish making coffee, rant about the World Cup with my friends, open the Fifa-dedicated Messenger group, and start a chain of an unnecessary game commentary to show people that I am watching the World Cup, as I switch on the television for one last kickoff, to support Croatia</p>
